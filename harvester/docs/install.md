# Harvester Installation

## Artifacts

ISO and PXE artifacts both available from <portal.ranchercarbide.dev/product/harvester>

Clickable download buttons generate pre-signed URLs to download from Amazon S3 in US GovCloud.

## Installation Process

Upstream docs at [ISO Installation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.7/install/index).

### Hardware Checks

The Harvester installer checks hardware specs, requiring a minimum of 8 cores/32GiB RAM for testing and 16/64GiB for production. Because we only have test-compliant specs on our mini PCs, we have to confirm we wish to proceed.
